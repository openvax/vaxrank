        Generates a tuple of scores used for lexicographic sorting of vaccine
        peptides.

        The most important criterion for choosing a vaccine peptide is to
        minimize the number of cysteines in the sequence (to prevent the
        formation of disulfide bonds).

        It is also important to keep the mean hydropathy of the C-terminal
        residues below 1.5 and also to ensure that no window of amino acids
        within the sequence has a mean hydropathy score > 2.5 (using
        AA values from Table 2 of Kyte & Doolittle 1982).

        If there are multiple vaccine peptides all of whose subsequence
        windows satisfy the GRAVY (mean hydropathy) < 2.5 constraint then
        let's optimize the terminal amino acids to exclude ones known to
        make solid phase synthesis difficult.

        If there are multiple vaccine peptides without difficult terminal
        residues then try to eliminate N-terminal asparagine residues
        (not as harmful) and asparagine-proline bonds
        (known to dissociate easily). If all of these constraints
        are satisfied, then attempt to keep the max k-mer hydropahy below
        a lower constant (default GRAVY score 1.5) and above a minimum value
        (default 0).
